# questions and answers (q&a)

*do you use any real instruments?*

very rarely! my music is mostly done with virtual instruments. but i try to
make them sound real. i can play drums and keys though, as well as my own
instruments...somewhat. but i prefer the piano roll and a mouse unless i'm
collaborating with other musicians in a studio live

*did you make all of this yourself?*

unless i otherwise specify, i do everything myself; music, videos, programming,
even this website. i do use royalty free assets and creative commons art/code,
which i give credit to when necessary. i don't feel the need to do it all
myself (in fact i want to work with others more) but it ends up that way because
it's harder to start a collab than to work on things i have complete creative
control over.

*do you want to collab?*

please message me if you want to collab because i really wanna work with other musicians more!
at the very least let's share ideas. one caveat for collaboration is that i do not work with
pirated VSTs or content, i no longer find it morally acceptable.

*can you give me feedback on a song?*

i love to give feedback! show me what you're working on!

*can i ask you a question? or just talk?*

yes! my DMs are open. i may not be super responsive all the time but i read my
DMs

*do you do commissions?*

i can help with whatever you need in the songwriting, production, or
mixing/mastering process, and maybe even with visuals, programming, engineering
or directing. contact me if you're interested in commissions, though as i'm busy
i can't guarantee i will have time or motivation.
i like working on cool things. convince me that your project is cool!

*what music do you like?*

check out my [rateyourmusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~BedrockSolid) page.
i'm very conscious of what i like and what i don't like to hear in music, and i
use that to my advantage because it becomes easier to get inspiration and to
identify issues in my own music. but yeah that's why i have a whole rating
system...
