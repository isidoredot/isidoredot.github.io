i am a music producer who loves songwriting, and i don't confine myself to
genres, but i particularly like japanese pop and art pop.
my goal is to one day make 10/10 music; music that is memorable, meaningful and
inspirational. and i'm happy to collaborate to reach that point; if you feel
the same way, we should talk!

i've been making music since ~2015, though i've only
been serious about it since 2021 or so.

i like using digital instruments because i can't play instruments that well,
and i like using VOCALOIDs because i'm not confident in my own singing, but
i also enjoy collaborating with real vocalists and musicians.

currently, i'm working on making my own vocalsynths and music hardware/software.
i'm an engineer so i design, build, and program technology a lot.

using the menu, you can check out my songs and get some behind-the-scenes
info, including early drafts. i hope you find it interesting!
