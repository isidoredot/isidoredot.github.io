project name: 354vcv

it started as a VCV rack patch for my electronic composition class (MUSI354). we
needed to make and perform a song at a scheduled concert as the class final
project, so the pressure was on to make something good.

in the beginning, it was a lot more prominent in the song.
i hadn't come up with the intro yet, just the cowbell refrain thing and
eventually a verse melody and the rap section drum loop

i then brought this draft home from college and recorded an intro using a bunch
of patches on my yamaha SY77. i love my SY77 because it's so unique
(mixing FM and samples together) and there's not really a VST recreation for it.

by this time i came up with the chorus section as well. i knew whatever the heck
i was doing was cool but i couldn't put a genre to it and i still kinda can't
think of many similar songs. my closest inspiration at the time was ONIRIC
by Kitazawa Kyouhei, which covers the trap influence, but there's also a bunch
of industrial sounds, synthpop, hip hop drums, and FM synths mixed in.

things are coming together, i figured out the bass for the rap section, which
was for another 354 assignment where we had to create a sampled instrument, so
i made an upright bass. i tried to do something like BROCKHAMPTON - Big P**sy,
which had just come out and i was listening to.

i have a buildup, no miku yet but i know i need it, so i exported the melody
MIDIs out and made a new project so the vocal mix wouldn't further kill my PC.
i tried to figure out the tuning for the rap section but it took me a bit to get
it down.

also, i started looking back at previous projects and found some that i could
incorporate into this song. so shoutout to me in 2018 and 2021!

insanity4.mp3

you can see where insanity4 is at the end, i guess i didn't think to put
deepstuffexample2 in until a bit later. you may also notice at the drop there
is a sample! it's uncleared so i replaced it with miku vocals later, but it's
from LAMP EYE - 証言, a song that defined the Japanese Hip Hop genre. shoutout
to _____ who recommended the song in an online language exchange program.

notice that the wav contains notes i put for myself in the project

while this was cooking i also was preparing my concert performance...which was
actually a rhythm game that i'd be performing live on a custom controller that
i built, with custom programmable lights. and it would look like i just
memorized a launchpad cover!

i asked my friend casey for some advice, fairly close to the concert,
so you will see that in the filenames

you may also notice there are some grammar issues in the lyrics at this point
also, which i fixed (i think...)

this was basically the final version i used for the concert. but i was not happy
with the mix, and i kept putting off fixing it to work on other projects. i did
export the stems for future me to deal with.

skip to almost 2 years later, i finally suck it up and decide it's time

354vcv_remix_20241023

okay i was able to mix it a lot better, and i layered some drums to fix the
timbre to be a lot better. but i needed to remove the uncleared samples or
replace them. i changed up the lyrics to fit my song but used the same flow as
____ did in 証言. i tried recording myself doing it...

354vcv_remix_2_20241026

didn't turn out that great. so my next try was to use miku

354vcv_remix_2_20241029

i asked my friends synk, DJ D, murito, and prob a few other people for feedback
on the drop to make miku stand out more. i got some conflicting opinions but
that allowed me to find a compromise. i ended up layering miku and synthv moca
together:

last minute i swapped the chant from "kiban" to "ganban" because ganban is more
explicitly bedrock, while kiban is foundation
