### project name: julieflutternot

okay it really isn't julie - flutter, but that's what the song originally came
from: someone asked how to recreate the guitar tone in that song, and i had not
heard it before but really liked it. so i was inspired to make an attempt.

i was slow to work on this and figure out what to add next every time. so there
are large gaps of time between drafts.

you can check the hooktheory for this too

i used synthv moca as a reference vocal but ended up using her actually. i
tried to get my sister to record vocals but it didn't match the song.

i kept trying so many alternate mixes but i finally accepted version 20250102_4.
not perfect at all and i lost the attack of the drums but the loudness is
good enough for streaming, probably. as of writing this it hasn't popped up
on spotify yet.

i asked @nataliee.s on instagram to do the art for me, which was different
from the idea i originally had (thinking of ____ on twitter) but i appreciated
her vision and i like the art a lot. had to shove the painting in a flatbed
scanner multiple times and photoshop the scans together to digitize it.
