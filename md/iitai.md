this was originally a collab with DJ D where he had written the bridge and i needed to write a chorus, i made a few choruses but he wasn't satisfied
so i took one of the ideas and made it my own song. it was originally called Project_42.wav and then i sent three melody drafts, project_42_2, project_42_3, project_42_4.
