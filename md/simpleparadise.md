project name: evil_yorushika

it's inspired by yorushika's thoughtcrime, and my brain went to those evil ____
memes, that's why i named it that.

this was my first released song but far from the first one i started for
isidore. i was really impressed at how fast i finished this because i had been
taking 2 years for every other song...and this was what, 3 weeks?

i was working on this during christmas and winter break, as the dates show.

you can watch me try and figure out the melody and progression in real time.
apparently i had a reasonable idea of the arrangement already

also notice how the lyrics and the tuning change as well.

"flimsy paradise" isn't as good of a title, is it

i use hooktheory to plan out my compositions often, so i mapped the composition
out there first and then put it down in FL Studio.

i got some feedback about the guitars from george (shoutout). i figured out that
i needed to adjust the release times of the rhythm guitar notes to make them
feel more realistic, and for the solo i applied chorus automation to give the
illusion that i double tracked the solo, which made it sound a lot more
authentic.

i started working on fixing synthv ayame's tuning as well.

i created a new project to mix everything from scratch, since i noticed it would
be hard to correct. since i worked on this song i have now realized that not
only did i fail to master it loud enough, but my arrangement/mixing with the
rhythm guitars fundamentally wouldn't be as loud as other rock songs, so ouch.
but here's some of the drafts
