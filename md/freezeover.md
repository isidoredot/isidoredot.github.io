project name: softwave

i wanted to make a "softwave" song, specifically like longlost's
"i wouldn't mind dying with you" which my friend/peer had choreographed and i
thought it was awesome. that's basically it.

for some reason i thought of "everything will freeze" and then
"Necrofantasia all hell freezes over" which was an old black MIDI that i still
have.

anyway here's a draft.

final version existed 2 days later but i almost sped the song up by 2 BPM. i
was convinced not to do that. but this is what it sounded like
