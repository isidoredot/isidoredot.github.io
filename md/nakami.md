NAKAMI is about conflicting values; wanting to help people but also trying to say no and steering away when people want help to do the wrong thing.
It's also about taking on too much work or weight to the point of losing the will to do anything. Taking care of yourself is important and being
self-sacrificial has a price.

on 2023-03-20 I made a project in hooktheory called "bossanova" which was a chord progression for a bossa nova song.
i think i wanted to make something like ShibayanRecords but couldn't figure out how to get it down. i wouldn't be
surprised if i was thinking about the vivid bad squad project sekai in-game theme

in 2024 i tried recreating delusionalism by MASS OF THE FERMENTING DREGS as a starting point because i really loved the
raw energy in it.

i looked for past projects and ideas that i could integrate to make a new song out of this, and i stumbled across the
bossanova project!

seems like i came up with the chorus, then the verse, then the pre-chorus, then the bridge. for the verse i was
definitely thinking of Izonshou -I Am An Addict- by Sheena Ringo which is just Bbmaj7 and F7 repeating
