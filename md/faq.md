# frequently asked questions

no one actually asks me questions. here's what i would want people to ask

*do you use any real instruments?*

very rarely! my music is mostly done with virtual instruments. but i try to
make them sound real. i can play drums and keys though, as well as my own
instruments...somewhat. but i prefer the piano roll and a mouse unless i'm
collaborating with other musicians in a studio live

*did you make all of this yourself?*

unless i otherwise specify, i do everything myself; music, videos, programming,
even this website. i do use royalty free assets and creative commons art/code,
which i give credit to when necessary. i don't feel the need to do it all
myself (in fact i want to work with others more) but it ends up that way because
it's harder to start a collab than to work on things i have complete creative
control over.

*do you want to collab?*

please message me if you want to collab because i really wanna work with other musicians more!
at the very least let's share ideas.

*can you give me feedback on a song?*

i love to give feedback! show me what you're working on!

*can i ask you a question? or just talk?*

yes! my DMs are open. i may not be super responsive all the time but i read my
DMs

*what music do you like?*

check out my [https://rateyourmusic.com/~BedrockSolid](rateyourmusic) page.
i'm very conscious of what i like and what i don't like to hear in music, and i
use that to my advantage because it becomes easier to get inspiration and to
identify issues in my own music. but yeah that's why i have a whole rating
system...

*do you do commissions?*

i could help with whatever you need in the songwriting or production process,
and maybe even with visuals, programming, engineering or directing. contact me
if you're interested in commissions, though as i'm busy i can't guarantee i will
have time or motivation. if i think your project is cool i'll be more likely
to help. or maybe if u have money
